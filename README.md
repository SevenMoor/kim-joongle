## The context
This project is part of our [Engineering Master Curriculum](https://depinfo.u-cergy.fr/cmi/) at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, as Bachelor 2 students. It aims to create a basic search engine in Java, that is able to reference all html documents from a chosen directory, put them into a sitemap, and return the documents that contain the search words in their ```<h1>``` and ```<title>``` tags. It will have a GUI and console version.
